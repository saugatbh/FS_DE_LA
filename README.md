This work was published in Bhattacharyya et al, MBEC 2014. This work proposed an efficient feature selection technique using Different Evolution and Learning Automata. The approach selects a subset of salient features that improves the classifier accuracy while reducing the computational speed.

Further improvement is required in the code to make it production level and also I need to create a documentation for it.
